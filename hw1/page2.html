    <h2>Hiking</h2>

    <p>New Zealand has absolutely incredible hiking throughout the counry. There are
    amazing national parks and the country has done a great job with conservation of
    wildlife areas and clean tourism. On my trip we visited 4 of the national parks
    that New Zealand has to offer and hiked 2 great walks, although there are many
    great hikes throughout the country.</p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Roy's Peak</span></h3>
    <p>Roy's Peak is a very steep, 5 hour trek to a peak overlooking the city of Wanaka.
      It offers incredible views the whole way up of what many would say is the most beautiful
      lake in the world. </p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Copland Track</span></h3>
    <p>I was lucky enough to experience "Tramping" in New Zealand where you hike up to
      a hut and spend the night there with other travelers. We hiked the Copland Track on
      the side of Mt. Cook for one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Hiking
      through all types of terrain and crossing huge passes via a tiny bridge was unlike
      anything I've ever done in my life. </p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Mt. Cook</span></h3>
    <p>We were actually lucky enough to hike up 2 different sides of Mt. Cook and
      I have to say this is definitely the way to go. In Mt. Cook National Park, you
      ascend up stairs very quickly and eventually get to a trail overlooking an incredible
      valley with snow capped peaks. This was my favorite hike of the trip and definitely
      worth the journey. </p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Kepler Track</span></h3>
    <p>The Kepler track is another great walk that is 4 days long if you complete the whole
      thing. Luckily there is a very popular 1 day trail that I was able to do. You start
      off hiking through forest and eventually come out above the tree line overlooking
      Lake Te Anau - another very beatiful lake in New Zealand. </p>
