    <h2>Cities and Lodging</h2>

    <p>One of the best parts of traveling to New Zealand was staying in all the
    different hostels. While we did splurge a few times on nice Air BnB's in
    select cities, nothing can replace the experience of meeting other international
    travelers trying to see all that New Zealand has to offer. By and large we stayed
    in the YHA hostel network that is prevalent throughout New Zealand. It was inexpensive
    and allowed a comfortable stay in rooms sleeping 6.</p>

    <p>You can explore the YHA website

    <h3><span class ="underline">Christchurch</span></h3>
    <p>Christchurch is one of 2 major cities on the south island. It is on the east
      side of the island so it is a warmer destination and allows you to go to the beach,
      however I would recommend only spending a few nights here. It is a good start to the
      journey, but the other areas of the island have so much more in terms of beauty and
      hiking that you don't want to spend too much time here.</p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Wanaka</span></h3>
    <p>Wanaka is a town on the west side of the island on Lake Wanaka. It is a beautiful
      town with great hiking (Roys Peak) and Rob Roy Glacier nearby. I loved staying in
      this town and would definitely recommend a stop here!</p>

    <h3><span class ="underline">Queenstown</span></h3>
    <p>Queenstown is one of the adventure capitals of the world and offers tons of
      options for action activities. You can enjoy incredible views bunjee jumping,
      skydiving, biking, and many more. Be sure to enjoy the Fergburger (best burger
      in the world) and other great food. Queenstown also has the most active nightlife
      on the island so be prepared to go out. </p>
